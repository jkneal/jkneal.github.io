                <h2>Breakthroughs </h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;You are practicing, working on getting better, trying different things, and then ... a breakthrough! You find something that gives a noticeable improvement in your playing. What was the change you made that brought about the improvement? Was it some deep secret, something you have never tried before? Not likely! Likely it was something that an instructor has already told you, possibly a long time back. And, likely something you have worked on before. So what took you so long to apply the advice and actualize the full benefits? Asking this question and forming strategies to minimize the time to 'breakthroughs' is the basis of effective practice.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is of course no magic formula here, nor ever a point where you can stop working on being more effective. Just like learning an instrument, it is an ongoing process. We are in a sense, learning how to learn.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this post, I will discuss some problems with typical practice strategies and how video can be used for a more effective strategy. Before we go on though, let's look at the learning process in general.</p>

                <h2>Build-Measure-Learn</h2>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my favorite ways to look at learning is with Rumsfeld Unknowns. Let's connect this to performing as follows:</p>
                     <ul>
                       <li>Known Knowns - These are the things that you currently do well</li>
                       <li>Known Unknowns - These are gaps in your playing that you are aware of, along with having the knowledge of how to improve on those gaps</li>
                       <li>Unknown Unknowns - These are gaps in your playing that you are not aware of, or gaps that you don't know how to improve on</li>
                     </ul>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For now let's set aside the Unknown Unknowns, we'll talk about those a little later.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When we practice, much of our time is spent trying to move a Known Unknown to a Known Known. We do this by trying an idea we have on how to improve, and then measure the result. In other words, we experiment.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-12">
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists carefully execute an experiment in three phases. First they build the experiment. An important piece here is controlling the variables. That is, in order to properly measure the effect of a change, only that thing should change in the experiment! After the experiment is carried out, the results are measured and compared with the desired results. From this the scientist has new information about that change (they have learned), which they can use to pick the next change and experiment again. This process continues until the desired result is achieved.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In musical practice, our experiments are rather loose. We certainly don't plan experiments like scientists do (nor should we). But many times since we do go through the process very fast, we run flawed experiments. This is most evident with younger students, but to a degree with all of us when we are practicing alone.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a flawed experiment? Let's start from building the experiment. There should be only one thing changing, but often when practicing other things are changing as well (without us noticing), or the change is not correct. Our measurements can often be off as well. This leads to incorrect information which informs our next experiment.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty comes from us being in the experiment! Since we are carrying out the experiment, it is hard for us to clearly observe what is going on. With others, we can easily see issues and how they can fix them, but not so when observing ourselves. Therefore, someone outside the experiment must perform the observation. This is one of the reasons students who study with a private instructor progress much faster than those without instructors. But access to an instructor or peer is limited, so what else can we do? </p>

                  <h4>Sidenote</h4>
                  <p>I am being very analytical here to explain how video and CritiqueSheet.com helps make practice more effective. I am not advocating approaching your practice sessions with a lab jacket and clipboard! With some more thought and planning our efforts to make a certain improvement can become more effective. But this is just one part of practice. You should also just play to explore (the Unknown Unknowns), and play to make music and have fun!</p>

                <h2>Roll the Video </h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Video allows us to capture our playing (experiments) and observe them later as an outsider. Generally factors we were not aware of are quickly spotted. It is also very common to observe the change actually made was not what we thought it to be. And finally, was the result as good as you thought? As musicians, the result we are working for is a desired sound. Video doesn't lie. We hear the true sound of what we produced, just like those listening to us will. Video gives us correct information that we can use to adjust our efforts.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many other benefits come from using video. What about those Unknown Unknowns? Video helps bring those to light as well. With additional resources (that we will explore below), the value video gives us can be greatly increased.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these great advantageous video can bring, why is it not commonly used as a practice tool? The problem is the process can be very cumbersome. In the past, this required owning and setting up a camcorder. Then to review, the device had to be connected to an external device (Television or Computer). </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, the process is much easier. Most of us now carry around (all the time) a mobile device that is capability of capturing good video/audio quality. Furthermore, video can be instantly transferred online and viewed on any device, or even reviewed directly from the mobile device (phablets are making the mobile viewing experience much better, not to mention 4k video soon to be standard on mobile devices!).</p>

                <h2>How CritiqueSheet.com Helps </h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;CritiqueSheet.com makes using video in our practice as convenient as possible, and offers tools for getting the most value from a recording. Let's see how we can use CritiqueSheet.com to help with the issues discussed so far.</p>

                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different setups, but the most simple is using your mobile device. Set your mobile device so that it can capture your performance (a tripod will be helpful, check out the Gorillapod http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/mobile-gorillapod/). Using the CritiqueSheet mobile app, you can start and stop recordings as desired (if possible, purchase a remote for you mobile device so recordings can be quickly created in place, for iphone check out http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/iphone-remote/).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to have a good setup so the flow of your practice is not impacted, and you are not discouraged from creating recordings. Try to setup your studio so that you can come home, snap in your mobile phone, and begin practicing! </p>

                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your captured video can be viewed immediately using your mobile device and the CritiqueSheet mobile app. In addition, recordings are automatically uploaded to your video library on CritiqueSheet.com. Just move over to a laptop or desktop to view your performance with a larger screen.</p>

                <h3>Analyze</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now comes the important step of observing or measuring our performance. Here, CritiqueSheet.com provides numerous ways to collect data and learn. </p>

                <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span>&nbsp;Self-Observation</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;First, CritiqueSheet.com makes it very convenient to analyze a video performance. Standard video tools allow you to pause, reverse, forward, loop,
zoom, slow down playback, and more. As you find things (both good and bad), add notes through the web site. These notes are then synced with a particular spot in the video (for referencing later), and can be printed or viewed with a mobile device for use in your next practice session.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have previously uploaded a recording, you can use the CritiqueSheet.com compare view to compare the two performances. This allows you to validate an improvement or compare approaches. Over time your video library will grow.</p>

                <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span>&nbsp;Reviews from Educators and Performers</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;CritiqueSheet.com offers educators and performers around the world that are willing to provide feedback on your performance. Find out what they see as your strong and weak points. The level of engagement can range from obtaining some tips to ongoing study. And, you are not just limited to one reviewer, send a request to as many individuals as you would like to obtain their unique viewpoint.</p>

                <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span>&nbsp;Peers</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, CritiqueSheet.com allows you to learn by comparing your performance to other peers. Search critiques to find peers performing the same piece, then watch their performance or use the compare view for more sophisticated analysis. You may also choose to open up your performance for comments from peers!</p>
